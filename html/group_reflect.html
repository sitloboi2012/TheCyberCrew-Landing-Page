                        <h2>Nguyen Ha</h2>
                        <p>In general, I consider myself a vital asset to this team since I am willing to share my thoughts and ideas, reliable, and eager to adapt to new things.
                            However, I was at first a little anxious about working with people coming from various cultures and are not really around my age because, for the best part of the past twelve years, I barely been in a multicultural learning atmosphere.
                            To my surprise, as soon as we set the ball rolling, I learnt that our disparities were definitely our strengths.
                            In the end, we managed to bring our relentless ideas to the table in developing a product that can well-reflect our efforts. Although we stumbled into certain challenges throughout the assignments, we were able to overcome them by sticking to the plans and being crystal-clear and supportive to one another. 
                            Our presentation is one of the project's most memorable aspects. It feels great to see how our thoughts came together into a powerful presentation.
                            Our commitment and hard work paid off, thus we received good evaluations from our lecturer and classmates. 
                            The amount of time we have together to really complete the project prototype is definitely something I would change, if possible.
                            Looking back, I can see on my end how much I have grown as a team leader and as a team member. It seems that any obstacles can be solved through efficient communication and teamwork, and that diversity can be a significant asset in any group scenario.
                            Joshua and I had haphazard conversations about our different backgrounds, did some language exchange, and we ended up learning much from these. 
                            Our team found time to crack jokes and enjoy each other's company despite working on a serious assignment with tight deadlines.

                        <h2>Joshua Hansen</h2>
                        <p>Being an exchange student from Denmark in a group with local students, I was met with many different surprises, challenges and experiences during our collaborative group work.
                            Even though there was an apparent cultural difference between me and the other group members, I was surprised to see how well my group received me both socially and academically and that we were able to produce high quality work whilst being social, sharing experiences and stories from our diverse backgrounds.
                            I want to highlight our academic efficiency with all our assignments and how ambitious and talented my group members are. Initially, I had the most experience at University and past group-working and being a confident student, I was certain to exceed any requirements and expectations.
                            I later found out that all my peers are exceptionally smart, hard working and inspiring to work with, as they show great potential as young and newly enrolled students. I am certain that all of my three group members will succeed beyond expectations in their future ventures and I hope to have contributed culturally and academically to future projects and experiences. 
                            Many improvements can be made during our time together, but I specifically want to highlight the need of being critical towards IT and the impact that it can have on us, socially and individually. The IT field tends to see technology as merely a tool to solve problems, which I can only encourage to rethink.
                            IT is a part of our identity, and as culture is a dynamic process, so is the meaning of IT in our society. With that in mind, I am glad to have shared my study-abroad experience with my fellow teammates and wish them all the best in the future. I will always have a social and academic door open for any inquiries that my teammates might seek. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>Tram Anh</h2>
                        <p>At first, I was a little bit nervous due to my lack of experience in working on a professional group project for such a long time like this before, and the members of my group were also talented, which accidentally put me under enormous peer pressure.
                            But finally, everything turned out to be completely different from what I imagined: all the members were friendly, contributive, and responsible.
                            If my memory serves me right, I do not think that we have had any struggles in building idea consensus, and work contribution, which has wholly dissipated the fear of team working in me.
                            Besides my 10 out of 10 teammates, I realised I had learned many things from this team project.
                            I am inspired and motivated by my talented teammates and the IT professional I worked with during the second assignment.
                            Compared to myself in the past, I believe that I have improved my communication ability, thanks to my amiable and reliable teammates.
                            Additionally, I gained knowledge and experience about the presentation, even though this one may not be my best performance, it helped a lot with the fear of public speaking.
                            In conclusion, there are still a few shortcomings that need to be overcome, but I would love to emphasise the industriousness, harmony, and understanding that we had while working together in the last semester.
