        <h1>Project Overview</h1>

        <div class="container">
            <section id="topic">
                <h2>Topic</h2>
                <p>The topic of our project is environmental sustainability and, more specifically, waste management in
                    Vietnam. Our project proposes a solution to tackle the ubiquitous issue of waste in Vietnam and
                    change the waste habits of the general public. Even though the scope of this objective seems
                    unattainable, we strive to shape awareness and create a physical artefact that empowers a more
                    sustainable future for the environment, with the overall goal of reserving precious nature and urban
                    habitat. With ambitious goals in mind, we generated a pragmatic but technologically sophisticated
                    idea to help change these current issues step-by-step. Our product is called WasteThaumaturge and
                    represents a physical smart bin that will be placed physically around cities. The product will
                    include multiple technological features to encourage its usage by people around the area, and it
                    will be adjusted to the habits and affordances of Vietnamese people.</p><br>
                <p>The outcome of the WasteThaumaturge is firstly to encourage people to sort their trash into the bin
                    and not throw it on land or water by making the experience of collecting trash into the bin more
                    exciting and useful. Through technological solutions, we want to motivate people to not just use our
                    bin but any possibility to collect and sort trash for further recycling. Our product is not intended
                    for monetary purposes but more as a staple of raising awareness about waste issues in Vietnam.
                    Moreover, the bin is not just to collect trash but to gain information about other habits and
                    insights into how people use trash bins and feel about waste management. With extensive data
                    collection, we want to find patterns and behaviours in people's usage of the bin and improve and
                    adjust the product so it becomes more convenient for their daily lives.</p>

            <section id="motivation">
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>As a group, we collectively share the motivation of utilising emerging technologies and current IT
                    trends to have a positive, sustainable impact on society in any way. In this project, our motivation
                    is to encourage change in the existing environmental problems of waste in Vietnam and to develop
                    technology that can support a more sustainable waste structure. The IT we want to incorporate in our
                    product is contemporary and fast-evolving technology in the fields of AI, IoT, and other smart
                    solutions. We want to use high-level technology and thus be a part of the future trend of using
                    artificial intelligence and networked IT to solve current issues. Rising technology gives us novel
                    opportunities to handle complex societal issues, and that is what motivates us to achieve our goal
                    of improving Vietnam's picture-postcard nature.</p>

            <section id="landscape">
                <h2>Landscape</h2>
                <p>There are already a handful of products around the world that offer a smart bin solution for public
                    use. Many smart bin solutions focus on automating the hardware by having sensors that make the
                    maintenance of a bin more convenient. This can be in the form of automatic composting, self-changing
                    bins, odour protection, and touch displays. These types of smart bins differ from our project in
                    that they focus on domestic and individual use, whereas our product is developed for open space with
                    a more approachable and intriguing design. There are also solutions that are similar to our product
                    and share the same motivation and objectives, which incorporate AI-recognition, automatic sorting,
                    and real-time data management for detecting insights (Bin-E, n.d.). This specific company focuses on
                    similar goals but might differentiate culturally, as this provides a global solution where we want
                    to focus on the specific habits and insights of the Vietnamese people and how to shape awareness in
                    Vietnamese culture.</p>
