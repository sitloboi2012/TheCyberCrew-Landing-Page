            <h1>The Cyber Crew Group</h1>
            <p>A minimalist and mnemonic team name came up with a view to making it simple to recall and connect to the
                team's goals and core principles. We emphasise the value of teamwork in the cyber area, which
                wonderfully conveys a sense of close-knit collaboration and camaraderie. Our attempts at preserving the
                Earth's nature lie in our efforts to do a valuable and essential project that makes use of technical
                "weapons" to address present-day issues in the real world.</p>

                <p>There is only half a month left until I complete my first semester in the Information Technology (IT)
                    major, and I have to admit that I have had so many wonderful memories as well as helpful knowledge,
                    which is and will be the motivation and preparation for me to continue pursuing this major. In the
                    past
                    two months, I have not only listened to the lectures but also had the opportunity to meet and be
                    inspired by IT professionals. From there, I could have a broader, more realistic point of view on IT
                    and
                    be able to orient my minor and my job in the future. After graduating, instead of continuing my
                    academic
                    path by venturing with a master's degree, I would prefer to seek an internship, do some personal
                    projects, and apply for a full-time job.</p>
