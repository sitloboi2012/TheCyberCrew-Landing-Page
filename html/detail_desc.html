            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>The specific aim of our product is to get people to throw their trash into designated trash collection points, such as containers and bins, and not on the ground or in rivers. Realistically, we want to lay the foundation of a better recycling infrastructure so it is easier to collect trash in bins before continuing the more sophisticated recycling process. Our bins should provide a simple way of collecting trash, both in bulk and in smaller pieces, and give the opportunity to sort for specific trash. That is why the main priority of our project is to provide a solid and reliable waste bin that is visually pleasing and encourages people to use it by being obvious and spacious. Its main components should be very easy to maintain daily, and the technology should not make the basic routine of changing the bin difficult. The main objective is to build a robust and convenient trash bin and add visual feedback and a sorting mechanism. Every other technological solution could be optional and only provide additional support.
                <br><br>To achieve our main objective, we need to engineer a good structure for our bin and make sure it is reliable and meets the standards of public bins. Furthermore, we need to make ethnographic observations and field studies in order to understand how people in Vietnam tend to use bins and throw away trash. If no one is willing to use a bin for their trash, then we need to change the way we employ our product. Firstly, we have to understand the people's willingness and awareness of waste management to guarantee the success of our project. Even though our product should be encouraged through visually pleasing design and feedback, its main objective is to be used as a waste bin by the general public. Furthermore, we need to consider the placement and quantity of our product, as we have to employ multiple products in busy areas. That means that we have to find a reproducible and cost-efficient way of developing our smart bin.

            <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>

            <p>The story of our project is rooted in the cultural shock of an international student in our group. While ideating, we caught ourselves looking for a topic with value that targets real sustainability issues, and as our brainstorming continued, we agreed on several aspects that we wanted to cover in our project. One group member was particularly captivated by the topic of waste management, as this felt like a very apparent struggle in Vietnam from the perspective of a western-European citizen. Before deciding our project's topic, we had a thorough exchange of experiences about waste in Vietnam and how the other local students perceive this issue in their daily lives. This was not just academically relevant but also an honest exchange of cultural differences in our group, which helped us get attached and motivated to our project. To avoid a fixation on one topic, we still settled on a deadline where each member of our group had to prepare two topics they found interesting. The task was not to come up with a potential solution but simply to generate as many ideas as possible that were all of personal interest. When the deadline was met, we evaluated each possible topic, but we all agreed that we saw the most potential in our original idea.
                <br><br>After we decided to work on the environmental issue of waste management in Vietnam, we quickly began to generate ideas of how we could impact this issue with a technical solution. We quickly pointed out the cultural behaviour in Vietnam and that regular littering is a common practice, although many people are not aware of the impact this has on the environment. In general, it felt like there was a huge opportunity for innovation in that field, and as we felt comfortable in our abilities and skills as a group, we were not afraid to tackle a complex and delicate topic like this.
                <br><br>Our idea generation went beyond considering mobile applications, web-platforms or robotics, and we collectively agreed that we liked the idea of building a physical device and implementing technology to make it a smart solution. The first thing that came to mind was to develop a trash bin that would help avoid casual littering because it felt like there was a need for a more reliable and common structure of waste collection in the city. In the beginning, we had no concrete vision of which technological solution should be featured in the bin, but we quickly realised that there were no limits to how we could design our bin. Our main idea was to include visual feedback for the users through lighting or audio and to have a data management system to analyse and develop insights into behaviour. Immediately, we explored solutions and technologies that can be used to make these features possible and found that there are multiple ways to realise our vision. We quickly settled on exploring Arduino circuits and a possible AI solution for data collection and analysis with the help of sensory technology. Later in the process, we brainstormed many more features that we would see relevant in future development, such as GPS, a sorting mechanism, audio feedback, touchscreens, Bluetooth, IoT, and more.
                <br><br>As our vision for our project began to develop, we researched similar ideas and competitors to see if other people had gained experience working in this field and to find inspiration for possible designs. We found multiple smart bin solutions and potential designs, but felt that we had to focus on creating our own product as we felt the need to specifically adapt our bin to the environment of Vietnam.
                <br><br>In our group, there was a strong agreement to not just focus on IT but incorporate a socio-technical perspective into our product and make sure to understand the impact of our technical solution in a social setting. We knew that developing a smart bin with sophisticated technology would not solve our problem or support our motivation unless we understood the needs and societal behaviours of Vietnamese people related to waste management and littering. There may not be a demand for smart solutions in this field, and that is why we need to include all stakeholders in our design process, prove its relevance, and deliver a product that people feel comfortable using. An idea could be to use the method of participatory design, which is a democratic design process that focuses on including all stakeholders with a special focus on the end-users. The design process gives every stakeholder an equal opportunity for input into the design and has a design-with-people rather than design-for-people approach (Rosenzweig, 2015). With a socio-technical view of our project, we can ensure that we adjust our product to the specific lives of Vietnamese people, thus guaranteeing a sustainable and valuable user experience.
            </p>
            <p>In the current stage of our project, we work excessively on finding the right design, prioritising the features that we evaluate to be necessary for our product, and starting to collect data from our end-users. With sufficient time, we would love to facilitate user testing in a natural setting with a beta prototype, followed by a co-design workshop where we invite a variety of people to have a qualitative insight into the critique, ideas, and feedback of potential end users. After extensive data collection and knowledge creation, we would then initiate the engineering of a first hi-fi prototype and potentially pitch our project to potential investors to financially support any further development. The technology we want to include in our project is very costly and requires huge financial backing.
                <br><br>Lastly, the next stage of our project would be the technical development of all the IT components that should be included in the smart bin. Setting up an AI classification model, GPS, visual feedback, and a GUI requires a lot of work and has to go through multiple tests and troubleshooting before deployment. This stage could potentially be outsourced, as the technology included is highly sophisticated and has to be reliable and reproducible.
                <br><br>The scope of our project is beyond our time in this particular class and requires intensive work and hours of work, but we are convinced that our product can have a huge societal impact and support Vietnam's goal of becoming less and less polluted. If our project should be outsourced or handed over to a new group of ambitious students, we would encourage them to dive into the topic of waste management in Vietnam, obtain first-hand experiences with the habits of the general public, and design a bin that is made with the help of the Vietnamese people who, in the end, will use the product. Furthermore, there should be a focus on evaluating which IT components are relevant and how to make the bin reproducible and scalable.

            <h2>Roles</h2>
            <p>Setting project roles helps our team facilitate task delegation, accountability, and deadline compliance. For one thing, each team member has a specific set of tasks and responsibilities that make up their project position. Moreover, good task allocation can give structure to the project while setting time frames for work completion, thus making it simpler to work together or solve issues. Should someone have a question about an aspect of the project, they know who to contact. The combination thereof yields the completed project.
                Up to this time that the report is written, we have identified these sets of roles for the members. A Data Scientist and a Web/Mobile Developer are needed in further stages.

            <h2>Scope & Limits</h2>
            <p>It is pivotal to identify the scope, recognize its limits and potential challenges in order to develop a realistic, strategic and viable plan for implementation.
                Table of essential features for the "smart" bin project:
            </p>

            <p>The deliverables of the project are highlighted above, with higher priority features listed first. These features include:
                A physical "smart" bin with an LCD display, three small containers for different types of trash, small cameras to take images of the trash, and an engineering arm for sorting the trash.
                Software features such as a user interface on the LCD screen, the capability to classify and predict the type of trash, signal the garbage collector when the bin is full, and track the location and conditions of each bin using GPS or tracking tools.
                Additional features such as user incentives like compliments, rewards, or fresh juice for proper trash disposal, and the potential to partner with drone technology or mobile waste collection units.
                For a first-year student project, it would be critical to focus on the fundamental aspects of the smart bin project and build a working prototype that meets the basic requirements, while keeping costs and complexity to a minimum. Future iterations of the design can be improved upon using the prototype as a tool for refinement. These features are considered essential for the functionality of the smartbin and are crucial for achieving the goal of environmental sustainability.
                It is also important to note that the scope of the project includes a single-piece trash classification mechanism and a 4G/tracking tool for real-time monitoring. WasteThaumaturge does not currently address classifying a bag of trash containing different types of materials, and the "smart" bin does not have the capability to self-move. The project's reach and impact may also be limited by its geographic location and target audience. While WasteThaumaturge plans to deploy the bins in Ho Chi Minh City, the project may not be feasible or practical in other cities or regions with different waste management systems and cultural norms.
                Additional features that are considered less urgent include 3D holographic educational videos about waste reduction and recycling, analysing trash data and providing feedback and suggestions on diets, voice-activated and verbal interaction for visually impaired, transforming trash into art or 3D-printed souvenirs for charity, an odour-detection component for a pleasant user experience, and an automatic compactor for more space-efficient waste disposal. These features are considered less essential as they are not compelled for the basic functionality of the smart bin, but may be useful for enhancing user experience (that makes our project highly distinguishable from the existing ones) and promoting environmental education and awareness.
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>Despite the fact that WasteThaumaturge has many intriguing features and promising benefits for environmental sustainability, there are also some limits to what the project can achieve given the current technologies, time constraints and lack of expertise.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Subjectively:</b>
                    <br>
                    Time management: can also present generic limits to the project. Without sufficient time due to team members may be taking up to 4 courses/semester, some may not be on the same page about project goals, timelines, or design choices, which can lead to delays, errors, and wasted effort. 
                    Lack of expertise in handling complicated projects: it takes a team with experience in planning, building, and implementing such projects to build a bin with a lot of capabilities. Without this experience, the team might find it difficult to pinpoint the best measures and might end up making costly mistakes.
                    Besides, creating a smart bin entails a blend of software and hardware skill sets, yet team members come from many backgrounds and areas of expertise and may find themselves unfamiliar with all the tools or technologies needed for the project which can result in errors, bugs, or deferral in the development process. For example, designing and building the smart bin requires knowledge of mechanical engineering, while developing the software requires expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning models. Overall, it is quintessential to address the constraints by providing proper training, guidance, and support to the team members.
                </li>
                <li><b>Objectively:</b>
                    <br>
                    First off, the bin will solely be able to classify single pieces of trash and not bags containing mixed waste. This problem will require future remedies by improving the sorting mechanism’s capabilities.
                    Secondly, even though the trash can alert the garbage collector when full, it continues to require human intervention in collecting the trash.
                    Thirdly, the project's ability to accurately classify different types of trash based on images may be limited. While computer vision and deep learning technologies have advanced significantly in recent years, accurately identifying certain types of waste may still pose a challenge. For example, distinguishing between certain types of plastic materials may require more sophisticated sensors or additional data points to achieve high accuracy.
                    Furthermore, it is dubious to what extent the project will change people' behaviour, despite its goal of educating users about waste management. Last but not least, the deployment of the bin network and sophisticated features may be expensive, which may restrict its applicability to some regions or groups.
                    Lastly, the project's cost and maintenance requirements may also be a limiting factor. Developing and deploying a "smart" bin system may require significant investment in hardware, software, and personnel. Apart from that, getting the system functioning properly over time could require continual technical support and maintenance, which might be tough to manage in the long run.

            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>In order for us to reach our initial outcome, which is a smart, eco-friendly bin that has the capability to recognize the type of trash that it belongs to, we do need to use different kinds of tools and technologies. In general, Google products such as Drive, Docs, Sheets are utilised as a means of creating and storing documents on cloud; while Github, Github Desktop (Version 3.2.3.0) and Visual Studio Code (Version 1.78) are for writing source code  and implement a shared workspace for team collaboration. Firstly, with the software part, we decided to use Machine Learning in general and specifically Computer Vision technology to help us classify the type of object through a camera that plugs inside the bin. This technology is not new in the Artificial Intelligence field, but it is one of the hottest topics that is getting lots of attention from both industry and academia. We recently decided to use a model that has already been pre-trained on the Internet, as this task is not rare and there are lots of different models that have been trained to do this downstream task already. There won’t be any problem in terms of the software licences for this kind of technology due to most of the Machine Learning model being open source and everyone being able to contribute to it. Next, we are also going to use Python as the main programming language for this project because the complexity of the syntax is low and every team member can learn it. But also due to its popularity with Machine Learning as well. Python is one of the famous programming languages that is used specifically for artificial intelligence and machine learning. According to Hackr.io, Python is one of the most popular and powerful programming languages for AI due to its code length, typing, difficulty to learn, community, and code bases that support AI.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>When moving on to hardware, since we need to convert the software into a chip or a mainboard, we consider either using an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi. Both of them have different pros and cons, and depending on what the use cases are going to look like, one technology could outweigh the other. When it comes to Arduino, people usually think about projects that have some repetitive tasks and are simple, like turning the lights on or off or reading from the sensor. The Raspberry Pi can be more suitable for performing tasks that are complicated and require multiple steps, phases, or different combinations of actions. But overall, both of them will be supported by Python, so that would help us connect between the software and the hardware. Other minor hardware items would include a camera that has a low frame rate per second (FPS), as this would help us take the picture faster and more precisely, and a 4G connected device, as this would make it easier to manage the location of the smart bin.

            <h2>Testing</h2>

            <p>For our project, the testing is of paramount importance for success, as it caters to a broad target group. Based on Rudd et al. (1998), it is beneficial to use multiple, parallel, lo-fi prototypes during the design of an artefact rather than high-fi prototypes to reduce design fixation, production, and design costs. In our case, this is only partially possible, as our testing would require a physical, robust product that is able to function in a natural setting. Our user testing would be divided into different stages, where we would <b>first</b> build a simple structure for the bin without any technical components. This is for us to focus on creating a bin that the general public accepts and perceives as convenient to use. By using a natural setting in this stage, we are able to observe if one design is more encouraging than another, thus getting a better insight into the user experience. The user testing would be cost-efficient, and as our product would be used in variable natural settings, it would be easy for us to deploy them for user testing. The testing would be structured with an iterative, daily summary that includes user interviews, field notes, and observations that focus on people's behaviour and usage of the bin. There is no limit to the amount of participation, as it would be placed in a natural setting, and more participants result in more data for us.
            <br><br><b>The second phase</b> would include a simple mechanism for visual feedback in order to observe if a visual feature would encourage the users to use the bin more. In this phase, it is important to conduct qualitative interviews and observations to measure the benefits of a smart bin over a regular bin and how this is perceived by the users. We would try to have multiple testing stations across different areas to see if certain patterns could be detected through geographical parameters. In general, our motivation is to incorporate as much user testing as possible in each design stage of the project, with a strong focus on contemporary design-thinking theory and approaches (Interaction Design Foundation, n.d.). This will guarantee us the ability to develop a relevant solution that can contribute to our goal of spreading awareness and supporting sustainable waste management.

            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>Developing an intelligent device has never been simple, and our project – WasteThaumaturge – is not an exception. Completing and producing a product requires a diverse set of technical skills, excellent cooperation, and last but not least, fortune. During the work, the possibility of not existing any problems is extremely low. Every project always presents at least several risks, which may lead to unpredictable consequences.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Lack of experience</b>
                    <p>Lacking specialised knowledge: The lack of expertise in manufacturing may lead to negative consequences on the project, such as increasing the risks of failure, increasing costs as well as delays, or decreasing the project quality, etc.</p>
                    <p>Lacking technical skills: Besides domain knowledge, equipping diverse technical skills is also required in order to build up a completed product. Without it, we would not be able to use specific tools and programs, which may lead to incomplete tasks. In addition, while working in a group, everyone also needs to have soft skills, such as communication and time management.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Cost</b>
                    <p>Product pricing: Product value is defined by direct material costs, direct labour costs as well as manufacturing costs, and distribution costs. Before the products got launched to the market, we need to rigorously capture the market share and gain deep insight into our products’ values in order to avoid mistakes in the products’ pricing strategies, such as overcomplicating pricing presentation, infrequently updating pricing, pricing based solely on undercutting our competition or not segmenting customers, etc.</p>
                    <p> Direct material costs: To build up an intelligent bin and turn it into a smart waste bin system within the whole city area which may be expanded in the future, this project needs to be thoroughly invested, and the materials’ quality is one of the most crucial factors that need to be prioritised. Hence, we need to focus more on selecting materials that not only fit our allowed budgets but also meet all the quality requirements.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Scope Creep</b>
                    <p>Scope creep is the phenomenon that the requirements of the project get added more to the planned project by the clients or investors, which may lead to the disadvantages of the project, such as increased expenses and delays. Scope creep is usually unofficial and happens during the completion phase of the project. The scope creep mistakes that we may be susceptible to are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The initial goal of the project is not defined clearly.</li>
                        <li>Unspecified scope and project limits.</li>
                        <li>Infrequently updating the project plans.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Poor project performance</b>
                    <p>Poor project performance can be defined as not achieving the set goals, meeting the requirements, or the expected results of the project. Some factors that can lead to poor project performance include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Insufficient harmony and communication: If there is no connection among the project team, the final product would be incoherent, or in the worst case, the project would never be completed.</li>
                        <li>Financial support and resources rarity: Our expected result of this project is the smart bin system would spread across the city, and in order to do that, capital money and investment money play an essential role. Managing financial resources is not a simple job.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </li>

            <h2>Group Processes & Communications</h2>

            <p>In the previous assignment, our team managed to meet the deadlines without running into any difficulties or conflicts. However, we have to deal with a particularly massive workload this time, including early stage development of our project and writing reports. Correspondingly, we came up with a  meticulous set of standards that shape how we function as a group to ensure that everyone is on the same page:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Channels</b>
                    <p>First of all, we ask all team members to make announcements, exchange information, and post updates via messaging apps and communication platforms, in our case, Facebook Messenger, Gmail, and Microsoft Teams. By doing this, it is possible for everyone to stay updated and interact effectively. In the event of important discussions, face-to-face meetings at school are preferred. 
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Rules</b>
                    <p>Next, polite and professional manners are expected during discussions. To eliminate confusion and misinterpretation, we advise team members to be succinct in their words:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be responsive: reply to messages ASAP whenever possible (if not within hours, one should make rational reasonings).
                            <br>** Notes: If a team member exhibited any signs of procrastinating or neglecting group work, we would issue a first warning. If one continues to act in this manner, we must either speak in person at the next tutorial session or consider submitting the case to our lecturer for final decisions.
                        </li>

                        <li>Be punctual.
                        </li>

                        <li>Update assigned tasks on the shared Google Docs document.
                        </li>

                        <li>Seek help should there be any problem with collaborating on GitHub.
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Frequency</b>
                    <p>Finally, we encourage regular (at least twice a week, one after the tutorial session and one at the convenience of the members) team meet-ups, either in-person or via Google Meets, to address project updates and complete the assignment. Team members are also expected to submit regular updates on their work or notify when adjustments have been made. A recap of the previous week's activities and a list of duties for the following one will also be included.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>Overall, we cherish transparency, collaboration, and respect within our workstream.
            </p>
