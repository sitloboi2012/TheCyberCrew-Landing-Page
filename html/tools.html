            <h1>Tools</h1>
            <p>With our initial step of the project, we decided to work on an amazing landing page which describes our idea,
                the timeline and how we will achieve our project specifically each step. We will use Github - a code
                versioning tool as a place to help us manage and record the changes to the code of the website over the
                time. Not only that, we are also using Github Pages, which is a plugin of Github to help us deploy and host
                the website on the Internet. This would help us easier to showcase the website and our idea anytime anywhere
                we want and everyone can access it to understand more.
                During the development stage of the website, some of the members faced a bit of difficulty when using GitHub
                for the first time in a real project. At first, the commit histories were vague and did not showcase enough
                information of how the code changed before and after the editing or what the member changed in the code.
                Furthermore, Ha - one of our members, incidentally merged the main branch with the development branch
                without creating a pull request or asking for review code from other members. This leads us to the problem
                that we need to sit down together and solve the conflict of the code that it created from 2 different
                branches. But over time, after some errors and through communication with each other in the team, every
                member in the group improved their code committing skills a lot. Not just only learning the best practice
                from the Internet which is creating a new branch for every new features, creating a pull request if anyone
                want to merge with the current version on the main branch, self-solving conflict, code review with each
                other and writing meaningful commit, but each member's ability to code using HTML, CSS and even JavaScript
                became better as well.
